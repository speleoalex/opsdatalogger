# FluxyLogger

Device for tracing air in caves.
It detects very well the butane present in normal air freshener cans.

An assembled and ready-to-use version, or in an assembly kit, can be purchased here: [https://techmakers.eu/products/new-cave-monitoring-n-a-s-o-datalogger-for-atmospheric-tracer-tracking-assembled](https://techmakers.eu/products/new-cave-monitoring-n-a-s-o-datalogger-for-atmospheric-tracer-tracking-assembled)
